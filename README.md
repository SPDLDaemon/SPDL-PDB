# Smart Product Design Lab - Power Distribution Board v2.0
## slideshow 
### [link to slideshow presentation](/218-pdb.pdf)
## features
* 8 3.3v plugs
* 8 3.3v and 5v plugs
* 8 5v plugs
* 4 14v plugs
* two 5v buck converters (to isolate servos from other systems)
* two 3.3v regulators (to isolate components and/or provide more current)
* 8 of the 3.3v and 8 of the 5v have signal wires brought out to separate pins so that for example all 3 wires of a servo can be plugged into the board and then the servo signal can be a socket-socket jumper wire from the pic board to the pdb
